        <h1>Node JS Report</h1><br>
        <h2>Components of a web application Node.js can be used for</h2>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Neflix using Node.js to reduce startup time by 70 percent.</li>
                <li>Linkedin moved from Ruby on Rails to Node.js. It's new app is now extremely lightweight and twice as fast.</li>
                <li>Walmart move to Node.js for their re-engineered mobile application. Node's asynchronous I/O mechanism and single threaded event loop moduels help handle concurrent requests.</li>
                <li>Trello used Node.js to build a single-page application with an event-driven, non-blocking server to hold many open connections for the instant propogation of updates.</li>
                <li>Uber uses Node.js to make scaling of resources simple as demand increases.</li>
                <li>Paypal used Node.js to bring cohesiveness to software develpoment by using the same programming language in both front and back end. Developers were united and worked better to resolve issues and react to customer needs.</li>
                <li>Medium uses web services for its web servers and follows a data driven approach, leverages A/B tests to get a comprehensive outlook on product changes and facilitates experimentation with new ideas.</li>
                <li>eBay uses Node.js to maintain a large number of connections per server and orchestrate many services that display alot of information.</li>
                <li>NASA uses Node.js in an application focused on keeping austronauts safe. IT moved all data related to EVA spacesuits to a single cloud database to dramatically reduce access time.</li>
                <li>Groupon rebuit their website on Node.js to unify their development across all platforms and improve maintenance.</li>
                
            </ol>

        <h2>Why use Node.js</h2>
        <p> Node.js is a JavaScript runtime based on Chrome's V8 JavaScript motor and uses an occasion explicit, non-blocking I/O model to be lightweight and productive.
            Developers use it to scale.. It deals with large numbers of solicitations without extra equipment. Reasons to learn Node.js include:
            <ol>
                <li><b>Demand in Market </b>- Many major international companies like Netflix, Uber, Paypal and Linkedin use it.</li>
                <li><b>Easy to Learn </b>- It uses the prominent front end programming language, JacaScript.</li>
                <li><b>Used for Full Stack Develpment </b>- It facilitates full stack development by not requiring a multitude of skills in different programming dialects.</li>
                <li><b>Easy to Compose </b>- With JavaScript, it's easy to compose in both the front end and back end .</li>
                <li><b>Versatility </b>- Node.js runs everyting in a solitary string that is non-blocking. Each client that associates with the server is dispatched another occasion that is taken care of simultaneously with other occasions.</li>
                <li><b>No Complex Code Required </b>- This is the result of its Versatility .</li>
                <li><b>Community Support </b>-Node.js is open source and has the largest worldwide network for support.</li>
                <li><b>Build Microservices </b>- Node.js makes it easier to develop, integrate, test and debug new functionality with microsvices to continously improve web applications.</li>
                <li><b>More Than Web Development </b>-Node.js can be used for a wide range of purposes including those working in operations or frameworks.</li>
                <li><b>Strong Undertaking </b>-Node.js is likely here for the long haul. No other apparatus brings JavaScript to the server. Node.js Foundation works to consistently advance its functionality so its aligned with the requirements of the designers who use it.</li>
            </ol>

        <h2>Types of Applications you can build with Node.js</h2>
        <p>Node.js has been used to create applications for IoT, Real-Time Chats, Complex Single-Page Applications, Real-Time Collaboration Tools, Streaming Apps and Microservices Architecture.
        Of these applications, IoT is most interesting. Pulling in field data from a multitude of sensors throughout large geographic areas, allows not only real-time monitoring to occur, but advanced analytics, automation and control. 
        Many applications can be developed that aggregate data, provide greater insights, automate control and can be positioned to fully leverage APIs with advanced machine learning and AI models.
